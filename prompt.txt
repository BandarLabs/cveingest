This is this week's vulnerability list.

Focus on those which will be interesting to experienced engineers, top security researchers - - this is the undertone, discuss code fixes if its there. Choose the ones which will be interesting to listeners.

Do not read out numeric and cve numbers - they are jarring.

Do not add fluff like generic security gyan about importance of code review etc, those are already known to listeners
