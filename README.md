# CVEingest - Prompt Friendly CVEs

Using this tool, you can gather and convert CVEs published by `GitHub advisories` and `cve.org` using one user interface. The tool takes care of fetching the references referenced by the CVEs. So, if some details like code changes are in some reference, it will be fetched.
