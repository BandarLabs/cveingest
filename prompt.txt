This is this week's vulnerability list.

Focus on those which will be interesting to principal engineers, top security researchers - - do not address them as it though, just the context, discuss code fixes if its there. Choose the ones which will be interesting to listeners.

Do not read out numeric and cve numbers - they are jarring.

Do not add fluff like generic security gyan about importance of code review etc, those are already known to listeners, just specifics of this weeks vulnerabilities will do.
